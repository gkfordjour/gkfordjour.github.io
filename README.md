## About
I am a Graduate Research Assistant at Tennessee Technological University, where I am pursuing my Master of Science degree in Civil Engineering. I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, where I graduated with honors and received multiple awards for excellence. My core competencies include machine learning, predictive modeling, deep learning and hydrological modeling.

As a Graduate Research Assistant, under the supervision of Dr. Alfred Kalyanapu, I am working on a deep learning-based flood forecasting model for predicting floods in inland areas in the United States. I use various data sources and tools to develop and test the model, and communicate the results and insights to the project stakeholders. I also assist in other research activities at the university, and contribute to the academic community. I am passionate about applying my skills and knowledge to solve real-world problems and improve the lives of people and communities. I am eager to learn from and collaborate with diverse and talented teams, and bring my perspectives and experiences to the table.
