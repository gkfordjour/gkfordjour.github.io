## About
I am a Doctor of Philosophy candidate in Civil Engineering at the University of Kentucky, where I serve as a Graduate Teaching and Research Assistant. I hold a Master of Science degree in Civil Engineering from Tennessee Technological University and a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, where I graduated with honors and received multiple awards for excellence. My core competencies include machine learning, predictive modeling, deep learning, water distribution modeling, and hydrological modeling.

During the summer of 2024, I worked as a Technical/Paraprofessional at the University of Kentucky. In this role, I developed and optimized water distribution models for utilities in Eastern Kentucky, collected and analyzed field data, including water quality parameters and pressure readings, and applied machine learning techniques to large datasets to extract functional relationships for water distribution modeling. I also assisted in organizing and conducting regional and utility-focused training workshops on water distribution systems.

Previously, as a Graduate Research Assistant at Tennessee Technological University, I developed a suite of machine learning and deep learning models tailored for flood forecasting and water resource management. Key projects included creating a deep learning-based flood forecasting tool using the Firefly Algorithm for Cummins Falls State Park and an LSTM-based flood prediction system with transfer learning techniques for watersheds in Tennessee and Kentucky. I also developed flood early warning systems for the Elk River watershed and Ashland City, Tennessee, leveraging genetic algorithms and high-performance computing (HPC) clusters equipped with GPUs.

I am passionate about leveraging cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning techniques to revolutionize water resources engineering, enhance public health and safety, and contribute to sustainable infrastructure development. I am eager to collaborate with interdisciplinary teams to drive impactful, data-driven solutions for pressing water resource issues.
